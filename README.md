# Neural Machine Translation

### 1. Seq2Seq

I worked on a seq2seq architecture on NMT using Encoder-Decoder model for translation of english sentences to german. I have used the dataset from [here](https://www.manythings.org/anki/deu-eng.zip). Basically, it consists of English - German pairs of sentences separated by tab delimiter. Since, it has over 200k data, for my model I've only used 100k records. Check out my [notebook](https://github.com/arunima2407/NMT/blob/main/seq2seq.ipynb)  

I will be working more on NMT and updating the repository with different architectures.
